## Description

I designed and developed Snazzle to familiarise myself with data storage, module bundlers and using different JS libraries for animations and transitions.

Data is stored in local storage using objects as the data structure.

### Functionality

- Create quizzes inside 'Quiz Maker'
- Set quiz title and fill in inputs for each question of the quiz
